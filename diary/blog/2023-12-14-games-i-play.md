  The class was essentially just the project in that repo plus some video
  lectures. Supposedly these lectures from MIT [0] are similar. Alternatively
  you could just read the course textbook [1] which I think is pretty good.
  Here's the course page [2] if you want to see more details, the syllabus,
  etc., and some student reviews [3] if you want more context. Many students
  found the course difficult -- it's one of the hardest rated courses in the
  program and rated it rather unfairly IMO -- it's a difficult subject but the
  course itself is about as approachable as you can make distributed systems.
