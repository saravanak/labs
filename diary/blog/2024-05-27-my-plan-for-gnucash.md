As an overarching portfolio development; and as a nice tribute to the ever
useful gnucash accounting application, I am planning to write a web UI for it.

## Overall idea

- Use the C bindings via Go.
- Use Next.js for Frontend
- Use Rest API.
- Compartmentalize with ephemeral uploads

### Usecases

The following are the additional benefits of using a web frontend.

- More flexibility on reporting
- Larger surface area to experiment on
- Demoable; popular domain allows for more participation when shared on HN.
