A collection of points and gotchas that I learnt while learning Go.

# go Embed

This was a new thing to me. Doc says it better:

```
Go source files that import "embed" can use the //go:embed directive to
initialize a variable of type string, []byte, or FS with the contents of files
read from the package directory or subdirectories at compile time.
```

Simple, and powerful DX. I remotely remember Java's resources but I think this
is much more powerful from what it offers. :mindblowing:
