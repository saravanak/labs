The following are my wishes in vim before I die

- Ability to select 'till' the end of a text object: for example, select till
  the end of the current function
- Ability to move out of matchpairs brackets while in insert mode. Eg: (curosr
  is denoted by !) [apple!] -> [apple]! without leaving the insert mode. This
  is much more disturbing.
