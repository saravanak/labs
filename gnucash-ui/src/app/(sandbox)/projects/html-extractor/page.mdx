import HtmlExtractorComponent from '@/components/projects/html-exractor';

## Introduction

This is a exploratory idea of using a DSL for extracting information in a structured way from HTML documents. <span class="font-bold"> Best viewed </span> on a wide screen

### Input HTML

This contains the data that we'd like to parse.

### DSL

This is a custom DSL in the format of `jq` using the pipe format. Each segment of a pipe can be a selector or a print statement.
The selector needs to return a list of nodes (`TBODY TD`) and the print statement will iterate thru the array and return a text for each of the nodes selected `map(## Set ${this.idx})`. The print statement will receive `this.idx` and `this.item` which is the index of the DOM node and the DOM node itself.

```jq
TBODY td | map(## Set ${this.idx}) | p | map(- ${this.item.textContent})
```

This is a live demo, and you can change the html or the DSL input string and see the changes.

### Implementation Notes

Currently this is impelmented using React client components, just as a simple POC. Not tested. Pre-Alpha.
