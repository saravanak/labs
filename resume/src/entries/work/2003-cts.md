- [[EmberJs](https://emberjs.com/), [D3](https://d3js.org/), [Dagre-D3](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3)] Developed a web based studio for designing charts using EmberJS.
- [Provisioning] Was responsible for provisioning and maintaining an internal Gitlab server for the project
- [C++]Engineered a Javascript execution engine(Rhino) using COM ATL within a custom rules language (which was compiled and executed by the domain code). The Execution engine had clear entry and exit points to offer extension capabilities for the rules languages. The Rules language was used for automating underwriting decisions in the insurance industry.
- [[Schematron](https://schematron.com/)] Developed a custom test automation framework to generate test scripts in Javascript and Java (4 different flavors) based on a test specified in XML DSL. The generated scripts would be used to test the functionality of different clients which are supposed to show the same functionality. The test framework used XSLT for transformation and Schematron for validating the actual behavior. This reduced effort in test maintenance.
