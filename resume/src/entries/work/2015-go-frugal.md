- [Whatsnow] Wrote a React based Hybrid App for Android and iOS. The app used a custom DSL to drive the conversational UI, which was designed to be a simple question and answer system, answering questions like ‘What is my sales <today|this month|etc>’ and ‘What are the profits for SKU’ and a couple hundred questions like this.
- [PhantomJS /Cucumber] Automated UI tests were done using PhantomJS and Cucumber Rspec.
- [Rails] Wrote a Rails API app for maintaining task domain models. The UI for the same was done in React as a single page app.
