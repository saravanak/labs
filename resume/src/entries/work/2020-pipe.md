> To our delight, Saravana really excelled with the work as a JS Developer, being highly productive and forward thinking; he implemented a variety of improvements, including a comprehensive test suite, as he went along. Without great effort on our part he could translate relatively complex tasks to working features. He is highly responsive when it comes to communication, and very friendly and humble in personality.
